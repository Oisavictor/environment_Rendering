Learning Node.Js - 
Setting up environment Rendering to browser File system

This project is intended to be used as dummy project for an assignment, but you should be able to try out the functionality  of my website that was rendered by the http server. For more details go through the quick start section of this README file to setup and run the Http server.

> ## Quick start

To test our app you can clone our repo using the following commands
```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Oisavictor/environment_Rendering.git

    cd environment_Rendering

```
`Note: you should have nodeJs installed before you run the next command` For NodeJS installation follow this [link]()

Next, open this folder with your favourite text editor such as Vscode. `We prefer you use Vscode`.

In your Vscode terminal enter the following commands.

```Javascript
node index.js
```
 Your result should look like this

```Javascript
 Listening to requests on port 8080
 ```
Now with your sever running navigate to a browser of your choice and enter the command into your address bar
```javascript
localhost:8080

or 

127.0.0.1:8080
```
This should lunch the base website

Voila :rocket: :dart: :fire:

finally to stop the Http sever use the command
```Javascript
Ctrl + C 

or

Command + C 
```
